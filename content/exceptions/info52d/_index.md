title: "Ephemeral recordings made by broadcasters (Art. 5.2(d) InfoSoc)"
short: "info52d"
draft: "false"
summary: "This (optional) exception or limitation allows broadcasting organisations to make ephemeral recordings of works, made by means of their own facilities and for their own broadcasts. The EU Court of Justice has pronounced ‘by means of its own facilities’ an autonomous concept of EU law in TV2 Danmark (Case C-510/10), interpreting it as meaning that a broadcasting organisation’s own facilities include the facilities of any third party acting on behalf of or under the responsibility of that organisation. The exception also allows broadcasting organisations to preserve records of important documentary value in official archives."
