summary: "This (optional) exception or limitation allows publicly accessible cultural heritage institutions (libraries, museums and archives) and educational establishments to reproduce works and other protected subject matter (other than databases and software) solely for non-commercial use."
more: "The EU Court of Justice interprets the limitation as applicable even without transposition into national law in Ulmer (Case C-117/13), pronouncing it an ‘ancillary right of digitisation’ for the purpose of making available on dedicated terminals by libraries under Article 5(2)(n)."
