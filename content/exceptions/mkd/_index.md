short: "mkd"
draft: "false"
summary: "This (mandatory) exception allows persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled to make an accessible format copy of works and other protected subject matter for their exclusive use. It also allows certain entities that provide services to those beneficiary persons to make such copies and distribute, lend or make available such copies to them on a non-profit basis. The particular rights (e.g. reproduction) covered vary according to the type of material used. The exception only applies to works in the form of writing or notation, and related illustrations, in any media, including in audio form. Only those materials to which the beneficiary person or the authorised entity have lawful access to can be used under this provision. Member States are free to decide if the uses undertaken by authorised entities established in their territory are subject to compensation. The exception cannot be overridden by contract."
more: "The entities that are authorized to make accessible format copies under this provision are subject to report, transparency and other obligations."
