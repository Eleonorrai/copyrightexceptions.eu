remarks: "According to some sources (see Vuckovic, R. (2019). Croatia. In: Lindner, B., Shapiro, T. (eds.), Copyright in the information Society), art.5(2)e. of the InfoSoc Directive is not implemented in Croatian law, and strictly speaking it is not directly transposed. However art.84 of the Croatian Copyright Act which implements art.5(2)c. of the directive, does include \"social (charitable) institutions\" amongst its beneficiaries, allowing the latter reproduction for non-commercial purposes.<br /><br />Under Article 4 (2) of the law, the provisions of this Act concerning exceptions and limitations of copyright shall apply mutatis mutandis to related rights."
