"Although the croatian 'public speeches' exception is relatively broad in most of its elements, it contains the requirement for the use to be limited to the extent necessary for public reporting on current events, which is a traditional restriction for the 'reporting on current events' exception, thus limiting the scope of the provisions.<br /><br />Under Article 181 (1) of the law, exceptions and limitations apply to both works (which must be divulged) and other subject-matter, subject to related rights. Article 181 (2) contains the requirements of the 3-step test."
