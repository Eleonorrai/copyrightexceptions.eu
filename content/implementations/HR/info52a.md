remarks: "Although the law does not provide for an express reprography exception outside of the opportunity for private copying, paragraph 3 of art. 183 of the Law provides for an 'appropriate compensation' in favour of rightsholders, that is additional to the compensation under the private copying exception (art.183, para 2) and is due by 'natural or **legal persons** who perform photocopying services **for a fee**'."
