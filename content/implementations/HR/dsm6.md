In parallel, <br /><br />Art. 187(3) of the Law of 2021 (on TDM) contains a legal definition of 'cultural heritage institutions'. An institution of cultural heritage is a publicly available library or museum, archive or institution of film or audiovisual heritage. This includes national libraries and national archives, as well as archives and publicly available libraries of educational institutions, scientific organizations and public broadcasting organizations.<br /><br />Under Article 181 (1) of the law, exceptions and limitations apply to both works (which must be divulged) and other subject-matter, subject to related rights. Article 181 (2) contains the requirements of the 3-step test."
