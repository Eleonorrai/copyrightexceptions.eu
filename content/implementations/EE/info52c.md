Subparagraphs 2 (making a copy to ensure the preservation of the work) and 4 (digitising a collection for the purposes of preservation) were replaced by the new subparagraph 2, providing no substantial change in the scope of the exceptions.<br /><br />The provision concerns copyrighted works. The exception is extended to related rights with a general reference to \"other cases where the rights of authors of works are limited pursuant to Chapter IV of this Act\" in ยง 75 (6)."
