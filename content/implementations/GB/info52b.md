remarks: |
 Section 70 permits reproductions of broadcasts for purposes of time shifting, Section 70 is a pre-existing exception.
 
 The private copying exception was implemented on 1 October 2014, but then overruled by the High Court on 17 July 2015: http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/2041.html
 As a result, Section 28B is no longer part of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. It is therefore no longer marked as 'implemented'
