 With regards to preservation of certain recordings, this is permissable as long as this is anticipated by the Act on Audiovision (Act No. 40/2015 Coll.). Specifically, such recording has to have an 'audiovisual value', as defined by the Act on Audiovision. This exception is regulated broader in comparison to the InfoSoc Directive. The exception should apply only to own broadcasting of the broadcaster comprising work, however the Slovak wording of this provision applies to any work.
