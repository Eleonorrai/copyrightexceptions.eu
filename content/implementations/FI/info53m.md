remarks: "ยง25e is introduced by Amendment 446:1995 and thus preceeds the InfoSoc directive. It does not follow the rationale or exactly correspond with the scope of art.5.3.m of the directive, however, it partially covers the scope of the exception by allowing the owner to use an architectural project or a building by altering the building."
