description: "The Finnish Copyright Act contains several provisions allowing for uses linked to the reporting of current events. § 25(1), p.2 allows for works of fine art which have been made public to be displayed in a newspaper or a periodical when reporting on a current event, provided that the work has not been created for reproduction in a newspaper or a periodical. §25b allows for works which are being seen or heard in the course of a current event to be included in the presentation in a radio or a television broadcast or as a film to the extent necessary for the informational purpose. When short extracts from a television transmission are used in accordance with §48(5) for the purpose of news reports on events of high interest to the public, a work included in the transmission may be incorporated into the news report."

remarks: "Apart from §25(1), p.2, and 25b, §48 (5) allows for transmitting organisations established within a country member of the European Economic Area to make use of short extracts from a television broadcast of an event of significant public interest in its own television broadcasts constituting general news programs. Although connected to the reporting of current events exception, the provisions of §48(5) seem to implement the requirements of the AVMS Directive and the ECTT on “events of major importance for society” and “events of high interest to the public”.<br /><br />The exception under §25b also applies to performances (§45(7) of the CA); sound recordings (§46(3) of the CA); film fixations (§46a(3) of the CA); broadcasts (§48(4) of the CA) and photographs (§49a(3) of the CA).<br /><br />§11(2) requires that when a work is used publicly under an exception, the author's name and the source must be, as a general rule, stated to the extent and in the manner required by proper usage. It also requires that the work must not be altered more than necessary for the intended use."
