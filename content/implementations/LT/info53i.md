remarks: "Like the case with the Lithuanian parody exception, the exception for incidental inclusion of copyrighted works was removed in 2011, leaving the corresponding neighbouring rights exception behind in art. 58(1), p.11. Unlike the parody exception, this omission was not remedied with the ammendment of 24 March 2022 implementating the CDSM Directive."
