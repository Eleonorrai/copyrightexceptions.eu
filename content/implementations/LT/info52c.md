remarks: "The pre-existing Lithuanian reproduction exception for CHIs was very narrow in scope. It was significantly broadened in implementation of art 6 of the CDSM Directive as of 24 March 2022, however its scope remained narrower then the InfoSoc model clause in art 5(2)(c).<br /><br />The exception also covers neighbouring rights under art 58(1), p.4 of the Law, according to which it is allowed to 'reproduce an object of related rights permanently held in the collection or fonds of a cultural heritage institution, other than an object of related rights published on computer networks (the Internet), where a copy of the object of related rights is made in any format or medium for the purposes of preserving such works, and to the extent necessary for the preservation of such works'."
