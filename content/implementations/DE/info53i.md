remarks: "According to the Bundesgerichtshof' ruling in the Moebelkatalog case (I ZR 177/13 of November 17, 2014) the exception must be interpreted narrowly. The evaluation as to whether the use is incidental or not, has to consider i) the viewpoint of the objective average observer; ii) the 'main object' of use; iii) whether the work included is only incidental compared to the main object of use. The BGH differentiated between a merely 'background role' and a genuine incidental role, which must comply with two conditions - interchangeability (the work is interchangeable with other works or could be entirely left out) and lack of relationship (conceptual, aesthetic etc.) between the incidental work and the main object."
