description: "This exception is not explicitly implemented. However, the CJEU interpreted the limitation as applicable even without transposition into national law and pronounced it an ‘ancillary right of digitisation’ for the purpose of making available on dedicated terminals by libraries under Article 5(2)(n) as a result of the German referral in Ulmer (Case C-117/13). In addition, copying made by CHIs for private users' benefit can fall under the private use exception as per Section 53, para 1, second sentence of the Act on Copyright and Related Rights (UrhG), per which copies may be made by 'third parties' on behalf of physical persons when the copying is non-remunerated or by ways of reprography."
