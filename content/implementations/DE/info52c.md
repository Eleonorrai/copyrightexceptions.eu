Libraries may also enable users, for non-commercial purposes, to reproduce up to 10 per cent of a work per session and to make reproductions of isolated illustrations, articles from the same professional or scientific journal, other small-scale works and out-of-commerce works. Rightholders may not invoke agreements which restrict or prohibit uses permitted in accordance with the exception to the detriment of beneficiaries."

remarks: "The exception under art.5(2)(c) of the InfoSoc directive was explicitly implemented in 2017. Before that the reproduction by libraries was to an extent covered by the CJEU interpretation of the limitation as applicable even without transposition into national law, being an ‘ancillary right of digitisation’ for the purpose of making available on dedicated terminals by libraries under art. 5(2)(n) - a result of the German referral in Ulmer (Case C-117/13). In addition, copying made by CHIs for private users' benefit could fall under the private use exception as per Section 53, para 1, second sentence of the Act on Copyright and Related Rights (UrhG), per which copies may be made by 'third parties' on behalf of physical persons when the copying is non-remunerated or by ways of reprography."
