remarks: "Most sources point to Section 46 'Collections for religious use' as the provision implementing art. 5(3)(g) of the InfoSoc Directive. However, Section 46 concerns exclusively the creation of collections intended, by their nature, exclusively for use during religious ceremonies, using 'limited parts of works, of small-scale literary works and of musical works, individual artistic works or individual photographs (...) incorporated in a collection which combines the works of a considerable number of authors.' This exception requires attribution as per Section 63 of the UrhG."
