remarks: "Poland has transposed the two exceptions in art.5.3.c. of the InfoSoc Direvctive in one provision, containing several different hypotheses based on different subject matter: e.g. reports for current events, short excerpts, digests and short summaries etc. can be used freely and for free; articles and parts of articles on current political, economic or religious topics can be re-used against payment of a statutory remuneration, unless the rightsholder has forbidden the re-use; while comments and photographs taken by reporters can be used freely against compensation, but the rightsholders cannot oppose the latter use. The provision of art. 25 is also cumulating to a certain extent the requirements for the two exceptions.<br /><br />In terms of beneficiaries, Polish case law has not been consistent. In one instance the Warsaw Administrative Court stipulated that the ‘press’ nature of a website was determined by its informatory purpose (Case n II SA/Wa 1885/07). However, in a later decision, the Gdansk Court of Appeal interpreted the term ‘press’ in a narrow sense, as ‘periodical publications that do not constitute a closed, homogeneous whole, appearing at least once a year, with a permanent title or name, a current number and a date. The above concept of press also includes the Internet press, however […] reprinting and posting of articles on a regular website can in no way be equated to the term ‘press’ indicated above' (Case n V ACa 687/15)."
