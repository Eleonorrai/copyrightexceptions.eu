Short excerpts of such articles, however, as well as digests of disseminated publications and works and short summaries of disseminated works are covered by the exception without compensation being due and with no opt-out option for the rightsholder.

- the rightsholder can expressly reserve the right to forbid further dissemination of articles (they cannot, however, opt out of the re-use under the exception of short excerpts of such articles, digests of disseminated publications and works or short summaries of disseminated works)
remarks: "Poland has transposed the two exceptions in art.5.3.c. of the InfoSoc Direvctive in one provision, containing several different hypotheses based on different subject matter: e.g. reports for current events, short excerpts, digests and short summaries etc. can be used freely and for free; articles and parts of articles on current political, economic or religious topics can be re-used against payment of a statutory remuneration, unless the rightsholder has forbidden the re-use; while comments and photographs taken by reporters can be used freely against compensation, but the rightsholders cannot oppose the latter use. The provision of art. 25 is also cumulating to a certain extent the requirements for the two exceptions.<br /><br />In terms of beneficiaries, Polish case law has not been consistent. In one instance the Warsaw Administrative Court stipulated that the ‘press’ nature of a website was determined by its informatory purpose (Case n II SA/Wa 1885/07). However, in a later decision, the Gdansk Court of Appeal interpreted the term ‘press’ in a narrow sense, as ‘periodical publications that do not constitute a closed, homogeneous whole, appearing at least once a year, with a permanent title or name, a current number and a date. The above concept of press also includes the Internet press, however […] reprinting and posting of articles on a regular website can in no way be equated to the term ‘press’ indicated above' (Case n V ACa 687/15)."
