draft: false
exceptions:
- info52a
memberstates:
- MT
score: 3
compensation:
- No compensation
remarks: |
 This is transposed practically word for word, including the provision that rightholders receive fair compensation. However, Malta does not implement a levy system, so there is no way in which rightholders receive the fair compensation provided for at law, unless by direct licensing.
