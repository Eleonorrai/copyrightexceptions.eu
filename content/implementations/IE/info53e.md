remarks: "Although not explicitly implementing art 5(3)(e) of the InfoSoc Directive, the provisions concerning permitted uses in relation to public administration also allow for any material which is comprised in records which are open to public inspection, to be copied, and a copy to be supplied to any person (Section 73 and 74).<br /><br />In Ireland there is no overall distinction made between works of authorship and related rights. Certain provisions are stated to apply to some but not all rights holders - for example moral rights are granted only to authors of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic works and film. However in general the provisions relating to ownership, duration, permitted acts, dealings and so forth, apply in the absence of a specific exclusion to every 'work', with ‘work’ defined as a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast, cable programme, typographical arrangement or a published edition, or an original database, and includes a computer programme. Performances and works protected by the database right are dealt with separately to the main scheme. (see Linda Scales in ‘Ireland’ (2019), B Lindner and T Shapiro (eds), Copyright in the Information Society, Elgar Intellectual Property Law and Practice, 471)<br /><br />The exception extends to performances as per Section 237 et sec CA."
