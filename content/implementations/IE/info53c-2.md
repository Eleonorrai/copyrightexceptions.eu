remarks: "Before 2019 Ireland had a general 'fair dealing for the purpose of reporting current events' exception in Section 51(2) of the Law, that could be interpreted as an implementation of the second hypothesis of art 5(3)(c) of the InfoSoc Directive. According to the previous wording of Section 51, 'Fair dealing with a work (other than a photograph) for the purpose of reporting current events shall not infringe copyright in that work, where the report is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement'. Curiously, in 2019 the Irish legislator removed the provision in its entirety and replaced it with a 'press review' exception in implementation of the first hypothesis of art 5(3)(c). However, the reference to 'reporting current events' in Section 221(1)(b) CA covering exceptions for the use of recordings or performances has not been modified in 2019.<br /><br />The 'reporting of current events' exception also does not technically extend to press publications, since the new section 13(4) of S.I. No 567 of 2021 introduces a reference solely to the new 'press review' hypothesis under Section 51(2)."
