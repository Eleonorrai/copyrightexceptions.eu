remarks: "Before 2019 Ireland had a general 'fair dealing for the purpose of reporting current events' exception that could be interpreted as an implementation of the second hypothesis of art 5(3)(c) of the InfoSoc Directive. According to the previous wording of Section 51, 'Fair dealing with a work (other than a photograph) for the purpose of reporting current events shall not infringe copyright in that work, where the report is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement'. Curiously, in 2019 the Irish legislator removed the provision in its entirety and replaced it with a 'press review' exception in implementation of the first hypothesis of art 5(3)(c).<br /><br />It is unclear what the extent of communication to the public under Section 52(2) is, since under (2A) 'otherwise' making available to the public of such a copy is set outside the scope of the exception.<br /><br />It is also unclear whether the current exception in Section 51(2) extends to 'recordings of performances' or not, since in the relevant provision in Section 221(1)(b) CA the reference to 'reporting current events' has not been modified in 2019. As of 19 November 2021 the exception extends to press publications as per section 13(4) of S.I. No 567 of 2021.<br /><br />In terms of subject-matter, there is no overall distinction made between works of authorship and related rights. Certain provisions are stated to apply to some but not all rights holders - for example moral rights are granted only to authors of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic works and film. However in general the provisions relating to ownership, duration, permitted acts, dealings and so forth, apply in the absence of a specific exclusion to every 'work', with ‘work’ defined as a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast, cable programme, typographical arrangement or a published edition, or an original database, and includes a computer programme. Performances and works protected by the database right are dealt with separately to the main scheme.
