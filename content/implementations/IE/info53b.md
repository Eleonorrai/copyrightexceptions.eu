remarks: "As of 2019, ‘disability’ in the Irish Copyright Law has the meaning assigned to it in section 2 of the Disability Act 2005, according to which 'disability', in relation to a person, means a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.<br /><br />Before 2019 Ireland had a more general disability exception. The 2019 ammendment detailed the regime and provided for contractual override in the law.<br /><br />Under Section 104B, added in 2019, the publisher of a relevant work must make or cause to be made at least one electronic form of the work which enables copies of the work to be made without undue difficulty, which are easily navigated, and which are capable of being modified. Unlike the general provision of Section 104, here any terms of a licence granted on foot of the general licensing scheme that purports to restrict this obligation shall be unenforceable.<br /><br />The publisher of a relevant work who is the subject of a relevant request may, by notice in writing given to the designated body which made the request, decline to comply with the request until the publisher receives a payment to cover the reasonable costs of the publisher that would be incurred in complying with the request. ‘Relevant request’ means a request in writing that the publisher deliver, in the manner specified in the request, the relevant material i) in such digital or electronic or other technological form specified in the request and to the address (which may be an electronic address) specified in the request, or ii) by permitting the designated body to access the relevant material. ‘Relevant material’ means the electronic form of a relevant work and any other material required to ensure that such electronic form complies with the requirements of the law.<br /><br />In terms of subject-matter, there is no overall distinction made between works of authorship and related rights. Certain provisions are stated to apply to some but not all rights holders - for example moral rights are granted only to authors of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic works and film. However in general the provisions relating to ownership, duration, permitted acts, dealings and so forth, apply in the absence of a specific exclusion to every 'work', with ‘work’ defined as a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast, cable programme, typographical arrangement or a published edition, or an original database, and includes a computer programme. Performances and works protected by the database right are dealt with separately to the main scheme. (see Linda Scales in ‘Ireland’ (2019), B Lindner and T Shapiro (eds), Copyright in the Information Society, Elgar Intellectual Property Law and Practice, 471)<br /><br />The exception extends to recordings as per Section 252 of the Law, according to which, 'a designated body may make a copy of a recording, for the purpose of modifying that copy to meet the special needs of a person who has a physical or mental disability'. The provision was not modified in 2019, and should not technically be subject to contractual override."
