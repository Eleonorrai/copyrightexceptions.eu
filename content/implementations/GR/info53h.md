remarks: "In 2015 an Athens court has clarified that five (5) cumulative conditions should be met in order for Article 26 to be applicable: i) the architectural works, fine art works, photographs or works of applied art shall be placed in public space or can be seen from a public space. So, a work that is not placed in a public space or cannot be seen from a public space are not covered. The same goes for parts of a work that cannot be seen from a public space; ii) the work shall be sited permanently in a public place, without a time limit; iii) the occasional reproduction and communication of images of architectural works, fine art works, photographs or works of applied art have to be two dimensional (2D); iv) the reproduction and communication of the work have to be occasional, meaning that it must not constitute the basic and most fundamental part of the communication. Instead, it must have a secondary and ancillary character; and v) the communication of the work must be performed by mass media, no matter who is the entity that proceeded to the occasional reproduction. The term mass media covers newspapers, magazines, broadcasters and the internet (Athens Multimember Court of First Instance, 3141/2015)."
