remarks: "The exceptions and/or limitations in Austrian copyright law are formulated as 'free uses' of works and other subject matter. The 'incidental inclusion' exception applies to performances (ยง71(6)), phonograms (ยง76(4)) and broadcasts (ยง76a(3)). 
Austrian case law follows the German interpretation of incidental inclusion and accepts that it must be insignificant, meaning that removal or replacement of the work used coincidentally has minor or subordinate importance with a view to the overall impression generated by the reproducing work (see Judgment of 26 September 2017, 4Ob81/17s)."
