remarks: "The exceptions and/or limitations in Austrian copyright law are formulated as 'free uses' of works and other subject matter. The personal use exception applies to photographs (§68(7)), performances (§71(1)), phonograms (§76(4)), broadcasts (§76a(3)). As per Section 40d (1), Section 42 does not apply to computer programs and under Section 40h (1), it does not apply to database works. However, any natural person may make individual copies of a database work, the elements of which are not individually accessible by electronic means, for private use and neither for direct nor indirect commercial purposes.<br /><br />
'Individual copies' means a certain restricted number of copies required by the nature and purpose of the 'own use'. The exact number is unclear both in cases of 'own' use and 'personal' use (see OGH 4 Ob 94/92 – Null-Nummer II) and must be established on a case-by-case basis.<br /><br />
'Lawful source' means that no obviously unlawfully produced model or a model which has been unlawfully made available to the public has been used for copying.<br /><br />
Under Section 42a (into force as of November 1, 2013) third party reproduction is also permitted by digital means against remuneration."
