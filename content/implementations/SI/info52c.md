remarks: "Compensation fees are regulated in a different legislative act - 'Regulation on the amounts of remuneration for private and internal reproduction' of 2006.<br /><br />This reproduction exception shares a provision with the reprography and the private copying ones and is cosidered 'reproduction for internal purposes'. The low score is due to the prohibition of reproduction of entire books and sheet music for the purposes of cultural heritage institutions, notwithstanding the purpose (incl. for preservation purposes).<br /><br />According to Article 4 of the CRRA, the provisions on 'the substantive restrictions on copyright' apply mutatis mutandis to related rights, unless otherwise provided in Chapter Five of the Act."
