remarks: "This exception serves as a fall back exception to the licensing provisions for out of commerce works in Articles 44 - 44b and only applies to sorts of works for which there is no representative collective management organisation that can issue licenses in line with Article 44. <br /><br />At the time of implementation, certain operative terms, such as the definition of \"representative collective management organisation\" or specific requirements to determine whether works and other subject mater is out of commerce are still being discussed in a stakeholder dialogue organised by the Ministry of Culture. The Ministry of culture can issue additional rules via an administrative decree.<br /><br />There are corresponding provisions in Article 10(r) of the Neighbouring rights act and 4a(e) of the Database Act. The exception cannot be overridden by contract."
