remarks: "As per Italian national case law, the exception only applies to fragments and parts of works.<br /><br />The provision or art.70(1) fuses the quotation exception with the implementation of the 'illustration for teaching' exception under art.5(3)(a) of the InfoSoc Directive. The second hypothesis of art.70(1) of the Italian law stipulates that 'if uses are made for teaching or research, the use must have the sole purpose of illustration, and non-commercial purposes.'<br /><br />The Italian law differs between exceptions, where use is exempt from the rightsholder's authorisation and no payment is due, and limitations, where payment of equitable compensation is due.<br /><br />Under art. 71decies, exceptions and limitations to authorsâ€™ right apply also to the neighbouring rights."
