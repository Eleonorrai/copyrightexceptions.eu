Article 25 allows for works which are being seen or heard in the course of a current event to be displayed in connection with information concerning the current event through radio, television, direct communication or film. The works may, however, be represented only to the extent called for by the information purpose."

remarks: "Apart from art. 23(3) and 25, art. 25a allows for works that are being seen or heard in a television broadcast to be displayed when a television organization transmits an extract from the broadcast pursuant to art. 48a. Art. 48a allows for television organizations established within a country member of the European Economic Area to make use of extracts from a television broadcast of an event of significant public interest in its own television broadcasts constituting general news programs. Although connected to the reporting of current events exception, the provisions of art. 25a and 48a seem to implement the requirements of the AVMS Directive and the ECTT on “events of major importance for society” and “events of high interest to the public”.<br /><br />The exception as per art.25 extends to the rights of performers (art. 45(3) of the Law), phonograms producers (art. 46(3) of the Law) and broadcasting organisations (art. 48(3) of the Law).<br /><br />Art. 11(2) requires that when a work is used publicly under an exception, the source must be, as a general rule, stated to the extent and in the manner required by proper usage. It also requires that the work must not be altered more than necessary for the intended use."
