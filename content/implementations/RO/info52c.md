remarks: "According to some commentators, art.35.1.d is the implementation of art. 5.3.n of the InfoSoc Directive. However, its first hypothesis concerning uses for the purposes of information and research only covers reproduction of short excerpts and does not mention in any way providing access to the public. It is not entirely clear what the relationship between the second hypothesis of art. 35.1.d. and art.35.1.d. is. The latter is clearly a literal implementation of art.5.2.c of the InfoSoc Directive, while the former represents an extremely restrictive approach to reproduction for preservation purposes by cultural heritage institutions. There is no known judicial interpretation available."
