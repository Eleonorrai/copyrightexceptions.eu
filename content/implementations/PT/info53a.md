remarks: "Portugal has two exceptions covering educational uses of works (Art. 75(2)(f) and (g)) and one exception covering the use of performances, phonograms, film fixations and broadcasts for educational and scientific purposes (Art. 189(1)(c)).<br /><br /> The main exception permitting the use of works for teaching purposes (Art. 75(2)(f)) is open to all users, but it is conditioned to uses that are exclusively related to the teaching objectives in the “establishments” (implying that the exception only covers formal activities, but without specifying which establishments are those). This exception allows reproduction, distribution and making available to the public of works. This exception is not subject to compensation. This exception requires attribution, is subject to the 3-step test, is subject to quantity limitations (it only allows the use of parts of works), and it requires that the uses are not aimed at obtaining, directly or indirectly, an economic or commercial advantage.<br /><br />The other exception allows the inclusion of works for purposes of creating teaching materials (Art. 75(2)(h)). This exception is subject to compensation, requires attribution, it is subject to the 3-step test and to quantity limitations (it only allows the use of parts of works or short works in their entirety).<br /><br /> The exception that applies to subject matter protected by neighbouring rights (Art. 189(1)(c)) is open to all users and it covers any uses both for educational and scientific purposes. This exception is not subject to compensation, does not require attribution, it is not subject to the 3-step test and it does not have any further conditions."
