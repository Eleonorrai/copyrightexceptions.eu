 Portugal did not implement the parody exception embodied in Article 5.3(k) of the InfoSoc Directive. This means that, if a parody reproduces, adapts or otherwise uses an existing work, the chances are that it will infringe on the exclusive rights of the author, since such uses are not exempted under the Portuguese law. Parodies are protected as original works in Portugal even if they are inspired in a theme or subject of an existing work [see Article 2 (1) (n)].
