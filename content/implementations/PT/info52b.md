remarks: "Portuguese doctrine acknowledges the fact that the provisions of articles 75 and 81 clash. This is due to the fact that art 81 was pre-existing at the time of the implementation of the InfoSoc directive and it wasn't revoked when introducing the transposition of art 5.2.b of the Directive. According to Vieira, J.A., Dereito de Autor, Dogmatica Basica. 2020, p.365, the legacy provision of art 81 does not require equitable remuneration.<br /><br />Equitable remuneration is provided for in art.76(1)(b). In cases of analogue use a remunation is also due to the publisher.<br /><br />The exception applies mutatis mutandis to neighbouring rights under art. 189(3) of the Copyright code."
