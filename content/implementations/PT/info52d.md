remarks: "Ephemeral fixation is regulated in both articles 189(1)(d) and 187(1)(c) of the Law, and the scope of the two provisions is almost entirely overlapping. This is due to the fact that they are both legacy provision that have not been changed since 1985 and 1997. Article 189(1)(e) also allows for the fixations or reproductions made by public entities or concessionaires of public services for some exceptional interest of documentation or for archive purposes.<br /><br />Indication of source is mandatory in Portugal for all exceptions. Under art. 76º n.º1 (a), the free use referred to in the previous article must be accompanied by the indication, whenever possible, of the name of the author and editor, the title of the work and other circumstances that identify them."
