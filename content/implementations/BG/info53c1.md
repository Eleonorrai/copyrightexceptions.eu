## Provision (unofficial translation):

24(1) Without the consent of the copyright holder and without remuneration, it is permissible: 
5. reproduction by the mass media of articles on current economic, political and religious topics already made available to the public unless such use has been explicitly forbidden, indicating the source and the name of the author, unless impossible.

## Case law interpretations:

**Beneficiaries:** No definition or express judicial interpretation of ‘mass media’ is available, but Courts generally include all websites in. 

**Types of Usage:** Reproduction only. However almost all available case law concerns MA by websites and online news providers and no distinction is made by courts between the two types of use.

**Subject Matter:** Covers copyrighted works only. Does not extend to performers (Article 84),  phonograms producers (Art. 90), film producers (Art. 90v), and broadcasting organisations (Art. 93). The respective referencing provisions do not reference this particular exception. Possible rationale: While no legal definition of “articles” exists, the constant interpretation suggests that the exception covers literary works exclusively.
Subject matter further limited by case-law: Articles only, but also  – “articles” must be journalistic and “creative elements should not prevail”- some articles on current events found “too” creative to fall under the exception by Courts. 

**Attribution:** The indication of both the source and the name of the author are cumulative conditions for the application of the exception (See Decision № 1724, 24.10.2013, Sofia City Court - Case № 5831/2012 - ‘When the article was reproduces in "A." only the author of the article is mentioned, but not the source, ie. it is not stated explicitly that the article was reprinted by the applicant's personal blog [...]. The defendant neither alleges nor engages evidence that the article was reproduced from another source, respectively that it is impossible to indicate the source. In view of the above, the defendant cannot invoke the norm of Art. 24, para 1, item 5. See also Decision № 2126, 21.11.2014, Sofia Appellate Court - Case № 544/2014)

**Opt-Out option:** 

* Very liberal interpretation of the Opt-Out option by Courts - rightsholder can express their disagreement to free use of their article post factum, by the act of filing a claim for copyright infringement. (see once more Decision № 193, Sofia Appellate Court - Case № 3149/2015 - ‘insofar as the defendant found out about the prohibition of the reproduction established when the claim was filed, from which moment on there was a violation of the copyright of the plaintiff and that circumstance should be taken into account in accordance with Art. 235, para. 3 Code of Civil Procedure.’
see also Decision № 787, 14.05.2015, Sofia City Court - Case № 3908/2014 - the plaintiff sent an e-mail containing an explicit statement not to reproduce her work and the same to be immediately removed from the site ********, to the person whose email address was published on the website. [...] However, this prohibition came to the attention of the defendant on [...]. From that moment on, there is an indisputable infringement of the copyright of the claimant, as the process feuilleton was uploaded to the site.’)
* Opt-out by the publisher is sufficient (see Decision № 484 of 26.03.2012, Sofia Appellate Court - Case № 1260/2011 - ‘The claim that the use of this material was not expressly prohibited is incorrect. Each issue of ******** in the editorial box states that the reproduction of text or photographs without the written consent of the publisher is prohibited.’ No deliberation as to how the publisher exercises the author’s Opt-Out option is available.)
