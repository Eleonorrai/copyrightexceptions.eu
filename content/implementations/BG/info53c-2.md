attribution: 
- indicating the source and author's name is required, unless this is impossible
otherConditions:

- use must be to a limited extent justified by the purposes of the information
remarks: "The exception extends to performers (Art. 84), phonograms producers (Art. 90) and film producers (Art. 90v). It does not apply to broadcasting organisations (Art. 93). Possible rationale: exclusive rights and short news reports in television broadcasting are regulated in the Radio and Television Act, where most AVMS Directive transpositions are.<br /><br />According to national case law, the hypothesis of Art. 24, para. 1, item 6 of the CNRL applies solely to works related to a current event and for the purpose of informing the public about the same event. It is beyond the scope of the provision to use a work from one event to inform about another event.<br /><br />The indication of both the source and the name of the author are cumulative conditions for the application of the exception."
